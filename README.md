How to authenticate google api stuff:

Login to the group gmail account and find the service account created for the gmail account in the api dashboard.
Make a new key for the service account, click save as json and store it in a new folder 'tokens' as 'private-key.json'.  
Add the service account email to any calendars you want to use. (go to settings for the individual calendar)

How to authenticate paypal stuff:

Inside the tokens folder, make a file called paypalId.json with the following structure:

{
"clientId":"clientId_on_discord"
}

And when testing the paypal transaction you can use the sandbox account login on discord

### MONGO SETUP

##### TODO: check security on this if they actually use it because this was done quickly

1. generate ssh keypair

2. get someone to add your public key to the mongo server

3. Bind the dig ocean server locally

```ssh -L 4321:localhost:27017 root@206.189.245.219 -f -N```

if it stops working (hangs on npm start), restart the ssh -L (ps aux | grep 4321, kill the pids, run ^ again)

If it's really broken check that mongod is running on 206.18.... , if not `mongod --fork --logpath ~/log/mongodb.log`
