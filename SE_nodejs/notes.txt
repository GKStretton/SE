The api is being accessed via a google service account

The email of the servicea account has to be explicitly added to any new calendar we  want to access.

In the google calendar api, dates/times are in the format:
[yyyy-mm-dd]T[hh:mm:s0.0z] - specifically, this is the RFC3339 format.

Concurrency control system:

User makes time slot selection and clicks book now - >
If free, the time slot is locked on the google calendar (with a unique id,
this unique id is also set in the cookie of the user)
The function in the back end starts a timer, which will remove the lock
after a certain time.
When the user clicks to make their payment, we check if a lock is still in place 
with the given id from our cookie. If so, we confirm the payment and replace the lock
with a confirmed booking.
