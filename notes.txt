Google api authentication and usage:

The api is being accessed via a google service account. We use this to generate a
jwtclient authentication token which is passed into our functions as the auth object.
The email of the service account has to be explicitly added to any new calendar
 we  want to access.
In the google calendar api, dates/times are in the format:
[yyyy-mm-dd]T[hh:mm:s0.0z] - specifically, this is the RFC3339 format.

Paypal authentication and usage:
Using npm paypal-checkout.


Concurrency control system:

User makes time slot selection and clicks book now - >
If free, the time slot is locked on the google calendar (with a unique id,
this unique id is also set in the cookie of the user)
The function in the back end starts a timer, which will remove the lock
after a certain time.
When the user clicks to make their payment, we check if a lock is still in place 
with the given id from our cookie. If so, we confirm the payment and replace the lock
with a confirmed booking.
