block description
	p
	|The award winning Community Centre holds classrooms of differing sizes and thus can play host to a wide range of activities, including ICT and computing lessons. Because there are no fixed fittings, each room has the capability to act as a venue for meetings or interviews as well as adult education, with the largest being ideal for a birthday party.
	br
	br
	|  Free parking is available on site.
