block description
	p The size of the Sports Hall makes it incredibly flexible and thus user-friendly. At its largest, it is ideal for
		|  sports like indoor football (Five-a-side and its variants) and hockey but can also be portioned to make
		| basketball, dodgeball and racket sports available. It is currently marked to facilitate all of these. The
		| area is clean, dry and has its own heating, the cushioned flooring making it safe for all. Because of its
		| size, it is also suitable for aerobic, circuit and individual fitness sessions. It would be an excellent
		| facility to hire for activities within a children’s party, giving the guests a vast amount of space to burn
		| some energy off.
	p Free parking is available on site.
