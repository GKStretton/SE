Because the seating folds back, the space is sufficiently flexible to accommodate theatre in the round, more intimate musical events or fitness-related and dance activities. It is heated and well lit, with disabled access catered for â€“ a beautiful setting for any event.\n\nFor a 4d tour of the theatre, click [here](https://www.4dtours.co.uk/4d/the-pictures/fullscreen/)\n\nFree parking is available on site."
